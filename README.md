# ARC-Well-Life-Cycle-Tracker

This program is publically visible only to demonstrate my working knowledge of Python!

However, this program has been incredibly useful in measuring key KPIs that are relevant to my job.
A big portion of my position is managing well servicing. Indicators of performance, such as well run life, are pivital.
Prior to this program being built this data was collected and analyzed in Excel. It was an onerous process. 
Now, it's a click of a button!
